# Final project 
## Overview of the project
As part of Data Analysis course at Code Clan, I had to answer the client's questions through analysing the provided data. The client was Scottish wildlife organisation which aims to protect animals. 

The organisation was primarily interested in wildlife injuries' trend by region, times of year, types of animals and in all combinations with each other. Also, they were interested in total call volume for advice calls and what was the trend in the provided data. Finally, they have asked to predict how this might look for 2021 including call  volumes.


## Raw data
Raw data contained free text data and there were no numbers at all. It covered the last three years: 2018, 2019 and 2020 (up to May). There were 4 main columns: description of call, region, time of when a call was reported and animal type. **Description column contained a sensitive data** and so it was removed after the cleaning step.
